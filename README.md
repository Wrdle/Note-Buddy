# Note-Buddy
Program was designed for notetaking but was never completed. The aim was to design a application for note taking that stored its notes encrypted and hashed in an SQL Relational Database. The program has a login system, splash screen and working login UI, however, the project was put aside as I became busy with school and I never completed it. Database is probably unaccessible now. 

# Images of UI
<table width="100%">

    <th>
      Splash Screen

    <th colspan="2">
      Login Screen - Side image was randomised from DB

# What I learned?
- I learned how to use TaskFactory to create a more fluid UI 
- I implemented basic encryption and hashing and attempted to understand it (very basic)
- I learned through problem solving and research how to manipulate bitmaps to ensure the images displayed were the perfect size for the screen to ensure no image stretching or artifacting
- I learned how to store images in MSSQL Server as a Memory Stream of Bytes
- I learned how to manipulate UI elements in windows forms using shapes in C# (very basic)
- How to fix windows forms scaling on higher resolution screens
